7 fun facts about JavaScript.

1. Javascript is used by majority of browser

Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute.

2. JavaScript is single threaded

JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.

3. Javascript supports regular expressions

JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.

4. JavaScript took just 10 days to develop.

JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich for use with the Netscape 2 browser. The original name for JavaScript was Mocha. In my opinion, I’ve gotten a few too many questions from non-programmers confusing JavaScript and Java, so maybe Mocha would have been the right call.

5. In reality, there is no longer one “true” JavaScript.

Despite all the organization done by ECMA, there have been many use cases added to JavaScript that aren’t officially part of the language spec. For example, React.js and other libraries use JSX syntax, which adds syntactic sugar for defining UI components. TypeScript is also a superset of the JavaScript language. It adds typing features designed to reduce the likelihood of type errors. While such features may not officially be part of the language, there are “transcompilers” like Babel that exist for translating them back into official, ES6 JavaScript to be run in the browser, server, or another application.

6. JavaScript is responsible for Web2, precursor to Web3

Maybe you’ve heard of Web3, the idea of a blockchain-enabled class of distributed web applications that will take over the world. Whether or not you believe in this technology, it’s worth knowing that the predecessor to Web3 is merely bidirectional site communication (Web2). Effectively, this means sites and apps that can communicate back and forth with a server, and potentially across other sites. And, of course, we have JavaScript’s “Ajax” requests to thank for popularizing this pattern.

7. JavaScript has many implementations, but a single “owner”: ECMA

You may have heard of “ECMAScript” or ES6 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 6), but did you know that ECMA is responsible for governing and maintaining the language specification? In other words, all of the crazy JavaScript syntax we know and love is attributable to ECMA, “a Swiss based not-for-profit association”. The highest-ranked members of this association are representatives from:
Facebook
Google
Hitachi
IBM
Microsoft
Paypal
So these companies have a lot of say in the direction of the language.
